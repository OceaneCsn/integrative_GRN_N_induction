label	description	pvalue
AT1G13260	RAV1	Encodes an AP2/B3 domain transcription factor which is upregulated in response to low temperature. It contains a B3 DNA binding domain. It has circadian regulation and may function as a negative growth regulator. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.	0.0238322788823488
AT4G36540	BEE2	Encodes the brassinosteroid signaling component BEE2 (BR-ENHANCED EXPRESSION 2). Positively modulates the shade avoidance syndrome in Arabidopsis seedlings.	0.0285733740668993
AT1G32510	NAC011	NAC domain containing protein 11	0.0365689697832127
AT3G15170	CUC1	Encodes a transcription factor involved in shoot apical meristem formation and auxin-mediated lateral root formation. The gene is thought not to be involved in stress responses (NaCl, auxins, ethylene). <i>Cuc</i> mutant was first recognized at the heart stage, where embryos lacking two distinct bulges of cotyledonary primordia were observed.	0.0203849840219967
